## README

This folder contains information for Kenya from the OHI global assessments. [View the explore-data file](https://rawgit.com/OHI-Science/ken/master/global_explore/explore-data.html) that will let you explore data directly from the `ohi-global` repository, or modify the `.Rmd` file. In OHI global assessments, Kenya has a region identifier (rgn_id) of 43. 

In a few cases, data files are saved locally as `.csv` files for Kenya only because data for all regions are too big and are not kept on GitHub.

- `explore-data.Rmd` extracts and displays OHI global information for Kenya by goal, and can be [viewed as an html here](https://rawgit.com/OHI-Science/ken/master/global_explore/explore-data.html)
- `stock_catch_by_rgn_kenya.csv` lists data by year included in the global assessments' fisheries sub-goal 
- `fis_meancatch_lookup` lists the species included in the global assessments' fisheries sub-goal 
- `rgn_spp_gl_kenya.csv` lists the species included in global assessments' species sub-goal
