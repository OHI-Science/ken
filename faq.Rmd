## Why is this study being done in Kenya?

There is a need to assess and track the oceans comprehensively in Kenya by combining the best available social, economic, and environmental information. This can help chart a path forward to increase economic opportunities and human well being while sustainably managing these critical resources.

Kenyaâ€™s use of ocean resources is set to expand, with fisheries, tourism, and shipping as key national sectors dependent on the ocean. County governments also have new lead responsibilities through devolution, and a new Blue Economy drive is a top national development priority, which is highlighted by Kenya hosting the global Sustainable Blue Economy Conference in November 2018. This OHI analysis can help to align actors from diverse sectors and across scales to ensure sustainable use of the ocean and future prosperity. Institutional contributors to the process included Kenya Fisheries Service, The Nature Conservancy, Pwani University, WWF Kenya, Coast Development Authority, Kenya Forest Service, Kenya Wildlife Service, Kenya Maritime Authority and the Ministry of Tourism.
